# C-Libraries
Abstracted C/C++ libraries which provide the functionality of common programming tasks/instructions but simplified.

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a set of abstracted C and C++ libraries which provide the common functionality within  the C and C++ programming languages, but more simplified for the software engineer compared to the current standard libraries and other third party libraries/frameworks such as "Boost". Some of the listed here provides complicated implementations and usages which I beleieve can be further abstracted, providing a higher level of implementation and usage which in returns provides a easy to understand application programming interface (API).

The abstracted C/C++ libraries developed within this project will only use the standard C/C++ libaries provided within the core language design, this provides native cross platform support in all library implementations for multiple operating systems.

# Project Plan
The project plan is to begin gradually developing C and C++ libraries, using a level of abstraction to reduce the complexity of implementing common programming instructions and tasks within current and new software systems.

# Further Information

1). Please refer to the document __"Technical Paper.docx"__ for further information about the libraries, headers and usage within the C / C++ programming languages.

# Example Programs

1). Library usage examples can be found within the __"Technical Paper.docx"__ and within the __"Example Programs"__ folder within this project repository. Note that the example source code provides __"Comments"__ which provides further explanation where as the technical paper does not, due to document formatting been cleaner and easier to read without the additional source code comments.
